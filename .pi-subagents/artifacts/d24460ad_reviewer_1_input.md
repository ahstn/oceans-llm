# Task for reviewer

Grill-style critique: interrogate this proposed GitHub issue direction for adding TypeScript integration tests to verify oceans-llm gateway works with TypeScript agent harnesses Pi and OpenCode, with MCP baseline Context7 no-auth starter, OpenRouter provider, basic OK response, and simple read/write file tool call. Identify ambiguous decisions, recommended answers, risks, and what should be in vs out of scope for a single issue. Do not modify files.
